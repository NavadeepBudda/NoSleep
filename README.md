# NoSleep

## Description
NoSleep is an innovative application designed to help prevent drowsiness. It's especially beneficial for individuals in situations where staying alert is crucial, such as during long study sessions or while driving. NoSleep uses advanced facial recognition technology to monitor the user's eye movements and head position, detecting signs of drowsiness and alerting the user with sound notifications.

## System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10/11, macOS X, or Linux
- Python 3.x installed (preferably 3.7 or newer)
- Webcam for facial recognition features
- Speakers or headphones for alert notifications

## Installation
1. Download the `NoSleep.zip` file.
2. Extract the zip file to a desired location on your computer.
3. Inside the extracted NoSleep folder, you will find the executable file and other necessary components.

## Additional Steps for Running from Source Code
If you are setting up NoSleep by running the Python source code instead of using the executable, you will need to manually download the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file, which is essential for the facial recognition feature.

### Download the Shape Predictor File:
The shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file can be downloaded from [this link.](https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat)
Once downloaded, place this file in the same directory as the NoSleep.py script.
Continue with the rest of the setup as usual.

## Usage
- Double-click on the NoSleep executable file to launch the application.
- Position yourself in front of your computer's webcam.
- Ensure that your face is clearly visible in the camera feed for accurate monitoring.
- The application will alert you with sound notifications if signs of drowsiness are detected.

## Features
- Real-time drowsiness detection based on eye movement and head position.
- Pomodoro timer for efficient work-break cycles.
- Customizable settings for drowsiness detection sensitivity and Pomodoro intervals.

## Troubleshooting
- **Webcam Access:** Ensure that NoSleep has permission to access your webcam.
- **Sound Alerts:** Check your speaker or headphone connection if you're not hearing alerts.
- **Performance:** Close unnecessary programs for optimal application performance.
